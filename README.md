"DESCRIPTION":
IRCTC Rail Connect â€“ Mobile App Redesign:

This project presents a redesigned prototype of the **IRCTC Rail Connect mobile app**, focused on improving the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). The redesign addresses major pain points found in the original app, such as:

- A cluttered and outdated layout  
- Small, hard-to-tap buttons  
- Confusing navigation and booking flow  
- Lack of visual hierarchy

The new design aims to create a cleaner, more intuitive experience for users by organizing key features clearly across four primary screens: Home, Train List, Passenger Details, and Payment. The goal is to make booking train tickets simpler, faster, and more mobile-friendly.
